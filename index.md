## Biography:

Welcome! Currently, I am a Research Administrator for the [Office of Contracts & Grants](https://www.colorado.edu/ocg/) at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder). I've been a Research Administrator since August 2022. Before then, I taught high school math from January 2020 to May 2022. I graduated from CU Boulder in December 2019 with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics, my Secondary Teaching License, and a minor in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. 

I'm excited to re-engage some of my math critical thinking skills via coding and dig into some Earth science data during this course.

I lived in Minnesota for the first part of my life and have lived in the Boulder/Longmont area for the last 17 years. I am appreciative of Colorado's mild winters and the lengthy ski season, especially at Arapahoe Basin. Outside of skiing, I also love to read various subgenres of fiction. My most recent favorite book is *Four Treasures of the Sky* by Jenny Tinghui Zhang. Over the last couple of years, I've also been taking pottery wheel classes. I have made many bowls, plates, a few mugs, and some lidded forms.
