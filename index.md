## Biography:

Welcome! Currently, I am a Research Administrator for the [Office of Contracts & Grants](https://www.colorado.edu/ocg/) at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder). I've been a Research Administrator since August 2022. Before then, I taught high school math from January 2020 to May 2022. I graduated from CU Boulder in December 2019 with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics, my Secondary Teaching License, and a minor in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. 

I'm excited to re-engage some of my math critical thinking skills via coding and dig into some Earth science data during this course.

I lived in Minnesota for the first part of my life and have lived in the Boulder/Longmont area for the last 17 years. I am appreciative of Colorado's mild winters and the lengthy ski season, especially at Arapahoe Basin. Outside of skiing, I also love to read various subgenres of fiction. My most recent favorite book is *Four Treasures of the Sky* by Jenny Tinghui Zhang. Over the last couple of years, I've also been taking pottery wheel classes. I have made many bowls, plates, a few mugs, and some lidded forms.

    * #### **The American White Pelican migrates throughout Central and North America over the course of a year.**
    * The plot above shows a few different noteable things. First, there is a presence of American White Pelicans in Florida throughout the whole year. Although, there is a stronger presence from December to March. This makes sense as the Gulf of Mexico is a popular spot for pelicans to winter in. Second, you can see the pelicans' migration demonstrated from March to June as the large amounts of occurrences shift from southern America and Central America up toward northern America and southern Canada. In June, the pelicans had an especially strong precense in northern America and southern Canada while the coasts of central America had much fewer populations.In July, you can see the populations begin to shift back toward southern and Central America.
