# Hannah Rieder

Welcome! Currently, I am a Research Administrator for the Office of Contracts & Grants at the University of Colorado Boulder. I've been a Research Administrator since August 2022. Before then, I taught high school math from January 2020 to May 2022. I'm excited to re-engage some of my math critical thinking skills via coding and dig into some Earth science data during this course.
